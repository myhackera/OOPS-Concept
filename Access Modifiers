Public Members:
--------------->>>>

Public members are accessible anywhere from the class. All the member variables of the class are by default public.

class edpresso:
    # constructor
    def __init__(self, name, project):
        self.name = name;
        self.project = project;

    def displayProject(self): 
        # accessing public data member 
        print("Project: ", self.project)

# creating object of the class 
edp = edpresso("TeamPhoenix", 1);

# accessing public data member 
print("Name: ", edp.name)  

# calling public member function of the class 
edp.displayProject()

Protected Members
----------------->>>

Protected members are accessible within the class and also available to its sub-classes. To define a protected member, prefix the member name with a single underscore “_”.


class edpresso:
    def __init__(self, name, project):
        self._name = name
        self._project = project

# creating object of the class 
edp = edpresso("TeamPhoenix", 2)

# direct access of protected member
print("Name:",edp._name)
print("project:",edp._project)

The variable name and project of class edpresso are protected; hence, it is accessed as _name, and _project respectively.

Private Members
---------------->>>>

Private members are accessible within the class. To define a private member, prefix the member name with a double underscore “__”.

# program to illustrate private access modifier in a class

class edpresso:
   def __init__(self, name, project):
      # public variable
      self.name = name
      # private variable
      self.__project = project

# creating an instance of the class Sample
edp = edpresso('TeamPhoenix', 3)

# accessing public variable name
print("Name:",edp.name)

# accessing private variable __project using 
# _Edpresso__project name
print("Project:",edp._edpresso__project)

In class edpresso, __project is a private variable; hence, it is accessed by creating an instance.
